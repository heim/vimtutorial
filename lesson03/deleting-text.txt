Lesson 03.

# Deleting text.

Sometimes you say or write the wrong things. More often, other people say or write the wrong things. 
This lesson is about removing stuff.

Tasks begin here:
-----------------

Task01: Deleting characters
---------------------------

You can delete the character under the current cursor using 'x'.
Correct the following line:

As a jjava programmmer I somettimess ennvy the C#-syntaxx.


Task02: Deleting more than one character at the time
----------------------------------------------------

Many commands accept a multiplier, for example the 'x' can be made to delete an arbitrary number of charachers.
Delete the extra characters by issuing '2x' on the appropriate places. Remember, you can undo the changes by pressing 'u'.

Hellllo worrrlddd.


Task03: Deleting, now with movements pt. 1.
-------------------------------------------

If you must delete more than one character at a time, the 'd' command is what you are looking for.
By itself it does not do much, but when issued with a movement, you can literaly change the world (or at least the current document).

To delete the false statement, navigate to the start of the second sentence and issue 'd0'. This means "delete to the beginning of the line".

OMG, I just love php. I love Ruby.


Task04: Deleting, now with movements pt. 2. 
--------------------------------------------

You can issue all sorts of movement commands to the delete command (and a huge array of other commands).
Try these on for size:

dd: delete the current line.
d$ or D: delete from current posittion to the end of the line.
dG: delete from current positionto the end of the document.
dgg: delete from current position to the start of the document
dw: delete from current position forward one word.
db: delete from current position backward one word.
d15G: delete from current position to line 15.

While playing with deletion-commands on the next few lines, you should undo the changes afterwards.

* Delete this line.

* Delete from - to the end of the line.

* Delete from any position in this line to the beginning of the document.

* Delete from any position in this line to the end of the document. Undo with 'u'

* Delete the extra extra words in this this line.

* Delete the extra extra words words in this line using 'db'.

* Delete multiple lines using 'd49G'.
