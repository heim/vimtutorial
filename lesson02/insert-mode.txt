Welcome to lesson two.

# Insert-mode

In this lesson you will get more familiar with the mode called insert-mode.
We use insert-mode to edit and add text.

To enter insert-mode, navigate to the place where you want to start insertion and press 'i'.

When you are finished adding text, press <ESC> to exit insert-mode.


Play below this line.
PROTIP: If you screw something up, exit insert-mode and press 'u' to undo the last change.  Press <C-r> to redo if you get too eager.

Task01: Inserting

Correct the following line.

Helo word.


Task02: Appending

As you might have noticed, 'i' inserts new characters at the current cursor position.
If you want to insert characters after the cursor position you can use 'a'.

Try this by putting a punctuation mark of your choice at the end of this line


Task03: Inserting and appending at the start and end of the line

Some times you want to edit directly at the start or the end of a line. To solve this you could issue '0i' to edit at the beginning, or '$a' to edit at the end of a line.
Luckily VIM provides a shorthand for this.
To insert at the beginning of the line use 'I', and use 'A' to append to the end of a line.
Try to complete the sentence in the next line using I and A.

When done get out with a bang: Hit ESC type ':' then 'q!'
You just left this place without leaving a trace.
